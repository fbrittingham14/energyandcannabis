      <h1>Your Cannabis Isn’t As Green As You Think</h1>
      <p class="lead">Why sun-grown weed is better for the planet and your conscience</p>
  
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Where Are These Emissions Coming From?</h2>
        <p>Indoor cannabis cultivation has become the dominant method since legalization, driving industry emissions through the roof.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>How Bad Is It, Really?</h2>
        <p>Producing one 1-gram joint indoors releases the same emissions as driving a car 12 miles, compared to just 2 miles for outdoor-grown cannabis.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Why Are They Growing Indoors at All?</h2>
        <p>Indoor grows offer consistency, higher THC levels, and more harvest cycles per year, but they come with major environmental costs.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>If Energy Is the Problem, Can’t They Just Use Solar Panels?</h2>
        <p>Even with 100% solar power, indoor grows can’t decrease their emissions to the level of outdoor cultivation. Outdoor cannabis benefits from natural sunlight — no need to burn fossil fuels to mimic nature.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Is There Anything Else That Could Make Growing Cannabis More Sustainable?</h2>
        <p>There are sustainability upgrades like composting waste, switching to LED lights, or growing lower-energy strains — but none have the impact of simply growing outdoors, which reduces emissions far more than all other improvements combined.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>What About Land and Water Needs for Outdoor Grows?</h2>
        <p>Outdoor grows use more land and water than indoor ones — roughly 5x the land and 3x the water — but indoor grows consume 61x more power, making energy the largest environmental cost.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
        <p>Support sun-grown cannabis by asking your dispensary about their sourcing, advocating for sustainable practices, and encouraging federal legalization to allow interstate commerce of outdoor-grown products.</p>
