                <p>When you think about cannabis cultivation,</p>
                <p>Since legalization began in Washington and Colorado in 2012, indoor cannabis cultivation has become the dominant method of production in all 22 of the states in which it is legal. And it’s driving the industry's emissions through the roof.</p>

                <h2>Why Are They Growing Indoors at All?</h2>
                <p>Indoor grows offer consistency, higher THC levels, and more harvest cycles per year, but they come with major environmental costs.</p>
                <p>Consistency, strength, and yields.</p>

                <h3>Consistency</h3>
                <p>Consumers have come to expect that every time they buy a specific product, it will give them the same high each time, just like we expect a Hershey chocolate bar to taste the same every time we buy one. When cannabis is grown outdoors, it is subject to varying weather and soil chemistry that could cause the makeup of the cannabis to vary from crop to crop.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3>Strength</h3>
                <p>The environmental control of indoor factories can lead to higher THC levels. At these levels though, it’s mostly a marketing ploy as studies show that the impact of increasing TCH levels on a consumer’s experience plateaus at levels above that of high THC outdoor-grown cannabis. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3>Yields</h3>
                <p>In these controlled environments, indoor cannabis can be harvested 5-6 times per year, leading to much higher yields than typical outdoor farms that can only harvest 1 or 2 times per year. However, supply has started to outpace demand and there is a lot of wasted cannabis each year. It makes us wonder whether the industry needs 5-6 harvests each year…

                <h2>If Energy Is the Problem, Can’t They Just Use Solar Panels?</h2>
                <p>It’s a good question—and one that many growers have asked. A Santa Barbara cultivator found they would need 25x the area of their roof to install enough solar panels to power their indoor grow. That’s just not feasible for most operations. And, it’s a lot of land.

                <p>Ultimately, legalizing cannabis federally would allow for interstate commerce. This means states that had the ability to grow outdoors would be able to sell their sun-grown cannabis to places where weather doesn’t allow. Write to your US Senators and Representatives to tell them you support legalizing cannabis federally.</p>

            <div class="col">
                <h3>Residents of other states where cannabis is legal</h3>
                <p>It’s tougher. But you can still make a difference. Talk to your dispensary, ask about growing practices, and let your elected representatives know you care about sustainable cannabis.</p>
